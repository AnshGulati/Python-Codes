# A Stack is a data structure that follows the LIFO(Last In First Out) principle.

'''
To implement a stack, we need two simple operations:

push - It adds an element to the top of the stack.
pop - It removes an element from the top of the stack.

x= ["Java","Python","C","C++"]
#Adding
x.append("Android")
print(x)

#Deletion
print(x.pop())
print(x)

#Traversing
for i  in x:
    print(x)
